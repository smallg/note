1. use angular material icons by local font
```
  I'm building for Angular 4/5 and often working offline and so the following worked for me. First install the NPM: <br/>
    npm install material-design-icons --save<br/>
  Then add the following to styles.css:<br/>
    @import '~material-design-icons/iconfont/material-icons.css';<br/>
```
